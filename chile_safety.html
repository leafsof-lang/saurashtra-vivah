  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Our commitment</h2>
    <p>Saurashtra Vivah strictly prohibits any content, activity, or behaviour that promotes, depicts, or facilitates child sexual abuse and exploitation. We are committed to protecting minors and complying with all applicable laws and platform policies.</p>
  </section>

  <section>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Prevention & detection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated filters and heuristics: we use automated tools to flag potentially exploitative content and suspicious accounts for human review.</li>
      <li>Manual moderation: our moderation team reviews flagged items and maintains escalation procedures for high-risk reports.</li>
      <li>Proactive monitoring: we periodically audit public and reported content to identify problematic behaviour.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Reporting mechanisms (in-app)</h2>
    <p>Users can report suspected child safety concerns directly within the app by using the <em>Report</em> option on profiles, messages, or content. Each report will be reviewed by our moderation team as a priority.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>If you encounter an immediate danger to a child:</strong> contact your local emergency services first, then report the incident to us.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Cooperation with authorities</h2>
    <p>We comply with applicable laws and will promptly report verified CSAM/CSAE incidents to the relevant regional or national authorities. We will also preserve and provide records and metadata to law enforcement when legally required.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Enforcement</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Accounts found to be in violation of these standards will be suspended or permanently banned.</li>
      <li>We remove content that violates our policies and maintain logs for investigations and law enforcement requests.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
