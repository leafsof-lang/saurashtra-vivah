🌸 Namaskaram, Patnoolkars!
Today’s fact: Our Sourashtrian ancestors migrated centuries ago from the ancient Saurashtra region of Gujarat — the land associated with Lord Krishna’s historic city of Dwarka.
Their journey preserved our language, culture, and weaving heritage across generations.
Proud to be Sourashtrian! 💛
